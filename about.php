<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
This is a software system engineering 4th year project. It is developed by two UofR SSE students, Chris and Wei.
</p>
<p>
As an online tracking application and system, What's in my yard has revolutionized the way that the Regina local communities
report and access the information about the surrounding wild species.
</p>
<br>
<p><h3>How Does It Work?</h3></p>
<p>
The system documents every sighting which is uploaded by users (local residents). A simple web interface is provided for single
sighting uploading or bulk data uploading. The user also can submit their sightings by sending us a email with predefined template.
After the data has been collected, our backend algorithms will process the data and store them into our database. Depending on
users' demands, our system provides various options for users to view the gathered data, such as heat map, and data graphs.
For the researchers and policy makers, our system also provides the option to download a certain portion of data based on their
own filter settings.
